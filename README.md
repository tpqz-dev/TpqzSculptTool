### Why this plugin
The plugin make it possible to stay in sculpt mode longuer and therefore make the sculpt process more fluid.
It integrates basic operations like : 
- adding/deleting object
- generate sculptable mesh on the fly
- split/join functions
- symmetry

With this plugin you can easily produce modular meshes that can be joined and became a great base for your sculpts.

### ESSENTIAL SHORTCUTS
Make your life easier and create shortcuts for the brushes you are using often :

    - modeling brushes (set for me to alt+ 0-9 )
    - masking (fill, remove mask)
    - object properties->viewport display->wireframe (will be set in the plugin on the next version)
    - transformation brushes (move (set for me to 1), scale (set for me to 2), rotate (set for me to 3))
    - line project, box trim (set for me to 4 & 5 )
    - Face sets
    - colors/ (fill)

A shortcut is created at the plugin installation to alt+X to show the custom menu.
